## CI is pinned

Every input to CI is pinned in the source (bats-lang/repository-prototype#269),
so a commit that passes keeps passing:

* `bats.lock` is committed: CI never runs `bats lock` for the package, so
  `bats check` and `bats build` fetch exactly the locked versions, and fail
  when the lock is missing or does not match `bats.toml`. A library's lock
  pins only its own CI and tests; its dependents still resolve their own.
* The compiler is the commit in `.github/bats-version`, read by every
  workflow that builds bats (and by the publish workflow).
* The package repository is fetched at the commit in
  `.github/repository-version`, so what the test packages under `tests/`
  lock (`bats lock --dev`) is pinned too.
* `publish.yml` and `relock-pins.yml` in bats-lang/repository-prototype are
  called by commit, never `@main`.

Pins move only through a reviewed pull request that runs the same CI. The
daily `relock.yml` (the shared `relock-pins.yml`) relocks against the
newest, moves the compiler and repository pins, pushes `relock/<date>`,
opens a pull request listing the old and new versions and dispatches
`check.yml` on it, so a breaking publish shows as a red relock pull
request and main stays green. GITHUB_TOKEN cannot change workflow files,
so without a `RELOCK_TOKEN` secret that pull request lists a workflow pin
that would move instead of moving it: move it in a pull request of its
own. A pull request that needs newer packages runs `bats lock
--repository <dir>` and commits `bats.lock` (and
`.github/repository-version`) with the change.

## Primitives only

bridge's JS offers generic DOM and platform primitives only; what to do
with them (which attributes, which roles, when) is the app's, in Bats.
A DOM primitive is an operation of the stream `dom_flush` applies,
addressed by element id like the others (CLONE_NODE copies an element
and nothing more: what the copy keeps is set by the app's own
operations on its id).
